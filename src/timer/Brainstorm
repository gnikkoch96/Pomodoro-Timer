Possible Features:
1. UI (Using Frame) to show the time going down
2. No Pause or w/ Pause
3. Reset Button aka the Stop Button
	a. The Reset Button should make it so that it resets to the first input of time that you input (might need to make
		seperate variables to hold these, so that we have something to reference to as the static variables change.
	

Extra:
1. Possibility to change the font type


Design
1. _ _ : _ _ : _ _ 		(Hour : Min : Sec)
2. Two Buttons on the bottom
	a. Start Timer -> Stop Timer
	b. Reset


How the Timer should work:
1. We ask the User to Place input into 2 or 3 Textboxes (Hour, Min, and Sec respectively)
2. Then convert those input into non-editable text while changing.
3. Second goes down all the way to 00, and then minute goes down, and so forth
4. I am thinking of using Thread.sleep() while decrementing the second
4. (Alternative-Easy)Using Timer Class that is made for Java
