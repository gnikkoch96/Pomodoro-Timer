Project: Pomodoro Timer

1. We are going to be using the Timer project as our timer which means that we have to make a reference object in this program
2. We create our own GUI (Frame) that asks the user:
	a. Productive Time
		i. # of minutes the user wants to stay focused for
		
	b. Break Time (Small)
		i. # of minutes the user wants to take a break for 
		
	c. Break Timer (Large)
		i. # of min the user wants after one hour has been completed
		
	
3. Use swing class, and keybinds when pressing begin
4. Include a picture of a Tomato at the top of the frame
5. Make this an executable and allow sound to play (one of the errors of the TimerGUI class)
6. Also, force the pop up window to rise up without any interupption as I noticed it just highlights rather than pops up

7. I noticed that a user might want to change the setting of the timer, so have a include a method that does that to the timer

8. After the productivity session has completed and an alert message appears, the button will then insert the break time in the fields of the timer
to execute the small break stage

9. I want to add borders around the jpanels (tomatoInputs) and the image

10. Find a better image (Rectangular V x Y where V < Y)

11. Once the user presses start Pomodoro, min = productivityMin, timer task should execute

12. I might need to make a seperate method in the TimerGUI class mainly for the Pomodoro class which will make the class very unique to the pomodoroGUI

13. How are we going to know when it is break time and what not? 
	a. Steps:
		i. Start Productivity Time
		ii.Finish Productivity Time
		iii.Go to Small Break
		iv. Finish Small Break
		v. Start again until (sum of productivity time exceeds an hour)
		vi.if productivity time exceeds an hour, then you go to big break
		
14. I also want to display a counter of how many productvitiy sets I have done.	

15. When I tried running the program on my laptop, the user interface was gigantic. I need to make it so that it is responsive to the computer rather than a 
static width and height

16. Turn this into an executable with a working timer sound and stuff

17. The textfields of the pomodoro should retain the previous values the user has entered

18. I might want to add a skip break button, so that it doesn't ruin the flow or actaully I can just add the productivity option with the display
